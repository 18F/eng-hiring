The goal of the core values interview is to determine whether or not the candidate’s personal and professional values align with 18F’s core values.

{% include unconscious-bias-warning.html %}

## Purpose

Broadly, the core value interview accomplishes two purposes:

1. **Tease out the candidate’s approach to value-centered agile teams.** Focus on agile, testing, open source/openness, and human centered design. While some technical discussion may come up, it should be kept high-level and general in nature.

2. **Learn about how the candidate deals with bureaucracy.**

The interview should last roughly one hour, and include some segments in which the interviewers provide more detail about 18F to the candidate and openly share their experiences working at 18F - remember, interviewing is a two-way street!

## Before the interview

Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the candidate’s resume and review [the good and bad signs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9A0WJFJj_Vo975RkuzQQazEOSJTPixiiahrtlNOBiI/edit#heading=h.ssudnodswllk) for the questions you’ll be asking.

## Conversation outline

{% include notes-reminder.html %}

Begin by introducing yourself by saying this or something similar to it:

> Hello! My name is \_\_\_, my pronouns are \_\_\_, and my role at 18F is \_\_\_.
>
> Thanks for interviewing with me today. This will be a behavioral interview, which means I’ll ask a series of questions about experiences you’ve had and how you handled them. There are no “right” answers; I’m interested in talking through these situations with you. I’ve got about [4-5 questions], and this will take us about an hour, perhaps a bit less. Don’t be surprised if others ask the same questions in other interviews; that’s normal. Feel free to think for a moment before answering if that's your style - you won't be judged for it.
>
> There will be times when I ask for more information, or want to dig deeper into your answers. That’s normal, too: I want to make sure I understand what you did and why. I’ll be taking notes, please don’t let that distract you.
>
> I’ll ask you my questions first, and then I’ll leave some time to answer any questions you’ve got for me. I’m excited you’re here - let’s get started!

### 18F's background, history, mission, and purpose

- "Has anyone given you any background on 18F or spoken with you in detail about 18F’s history, purpose, and mission?"
    - If not, fill them in; if so, answer questions (if they've got them).

- ["Can you tell me a little bit about your background and how 18F fits into that picture?"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9A0WJFJj_Vo975RkuzQQazEOSJTPixiiahrtlNOBiI/edit#heading=h.6qssbuvkhie2)

Make a note of key phrases or words that the candidate mentions their response (e.g., “I want my work to have a meaningful impact”); you can use these hooks for questions later in the interview as you transition from one set of questions to the next.

### Relevant work experience

After the introduction, follow up with a discussion around relevant work experience. Tying into anything the candidate might have already responded with as well as their resume, guide the interview toward specific work experience(s) that are of interest to 18F’s current and future needs.

This question could go in a few different directions depending on the candidates experience. Ask one (or more) of the following:

- [Tell me a bit more about your experience at COMPANY / on PROJECT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9A0WJFJj_Vo975RkuzQQazEOSJTPixiiahrtlNOBiI/edit#heading=h.8gbmhtmnymv9)
    - What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
    - If a project: Why did the project succeed/fail?
    - If a company: Why did/are you ultimately decide/deciding to move on?

- [Have you worked directly with customers/clients before?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9A0WJFJj_Vo975RkuzQQazEOSJTPixiiahrtlNOBiI/edit#heading=h.8w4325mhjtnd)
    - If applicable: Could you speak about a time when you dealt with a particularly difficult client?

- [Tell me about your experience working on teams that directly involved non-engineers. How did you approach working with others with different professional skills?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9A0WJFJj_Vo975RkuzQQazEOSJTPixiiahrtlNOBiI/edit#heading=h.6qssa3tfp2ht)
    - How did you resolve any conflicts that arose?
    - How did you incorporate other perspectives into your technical choices, especially when that might lead you to a different technical strategy?


### Communication and collaboration

Following a discussion around a candidate’s relevant work experience, transition into a more focused dialogue around communication itself.

Ask one (or more) of these questions, as appropriate:

- [18F is a fully distributed, remote team. What steps would you take to ensure that you and your team are always in sync with each other?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9A0WJFJj_Vo975RkuzQQazEOSJTPixiiahrtlNOBiI/edit#heading=h.kbq69akgkj00)
    - (If the candidate only talks about communicating with other engineers) How do you know if you’re communicating well with designers, PMs, product owners, and other non-engineers on your team?

- [Can you describe a time or situation in which you saw or noted something that wasn’t working well and advocated for an improvement?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9A0WJFJj_Vo975RkuzQQazEOSJTPixiiahrtlNOBiI/edit#heading=h.2jqlt72nbfcu)
    - If applicable: What challenges did you face in doing this?
    - If applicable: Did your efforts succeed or fail, and can you explain why?
    - If applicable: Did you solicit help from your colleagues and/or manager?


### Diversity, equity, and inclusion

Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core values for 18F and the engineering chapter. These questions are meant to shed light on the candidate's experience and thoughts.

- "[Tell me about a time you’ve worked with or for communities different than your own. What did you learn?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9A0WJFJj_Vo975RkuzQQazEOSJTPixiiahrtlNOBiI/edit#heading=h.u30z4bws4grp)"
    - What do diversity and inclusion mean to you?
    - How do you take equity into consideration in your software practice?

### Overall experience and outlook

Begin closing the interview by asking general questions to ensure we develop a more well-rounded picture of the candidate. These questions aren’t geared toward a specific job or work methodology. Instead, they’re meant to shed light into the candidate’s overall experience and outlook.

Ask one or more of the following:

- [At 18F, we sometimes find ourselves needing to create a strategic direction from  conflicting expectations. Tell me about a time you had to reset expectations with a product owner or customer and how you went about it.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9A0WJFJj_Vo975RkuzQQazEOSJTPixiiahrtlNOBiI/edit#heading=h.2i6wokvb700e)
- [Tell me about what you’ve done that you’re most proud of.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9A0WJFJj_Vo975RkuzQQazEOSJTPixiiahrtlNOBiI/edit#heading=h.pssei38irerc)


**Lastly, make sure to ask the candidate if they have any questions for you!**

## After the interview

**Thank you for your focus!** Use your notes to fill out the feedback form linked in the calendar invitation, which will prepare you for the [debrief meeting]({{site.baseurl}}/debrief/).
