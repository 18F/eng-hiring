The goal of the wrap-up interview is to address any concerns that may be outstanding in order to prepare for a hiring decision.

{% include unconscious-bias-warning.html %}

## Purpose

The wrap-up interview accomplishes two purposes:

1. **Follow-up on any topics which other interviews did not address in-depth.** When reviewing notes, interviewers may have additional areas where they wished they would have had a deeper understanding — this interview provides an opportunity to follow-up.

2. **Provide a second opinion on core values and technical topics.** This can serve to better define some of the candidates answers when discussing them during the [debrief meeting]({{site.baseurl}}/debrief/).

The interview should last roughly one hour, and include some segments in which the interviewers provide more detail about 18F to the candidate and openly share their experiences working at 18F — remember, interviewing is a two-way street!

## Before the interview

- Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the candidate’s resume and review [the good and bad signs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit) for the questions you’ll be asking.

- Ask the other interviewers if there are any areas to probe (without asking *why* — that will bias your opinion of the candidate’s answers).

## Conversation outline

{% include notes-reminder.html %}

Begin by introducing yourself by saying this or something similar to it:

> Hello! My name is \_\_\_, my pronouns are \_\_\_, and my role at 18F is \_\_\_.
>
> Thanks for interviewing with me today. This will be a behavioral interview, which means I’ll ask a series of questions about experiences you’ve had and how you handled them. There are no “right” answers; I’m interested in talking through these situations with you. I’ve got about [4-5 questions], and this will take us about an hour, perhaps a bit less. Don’t be surprised if others have asked the same questions in other interviews; that’s normal. Feel free to think for a moment before answering if that's your style - you won't be judged for it.
>
> There will be times when I ask for more information, or want to dig deeper into your answers. That’s normal, too: I want to make sure I understand what you did and why. I’ll be taking notes, please don’t let that distract you.
>
> I’ll ask you my questions first, and then I’ll leave some time to answer any questions you’ve got for me. I’m excited you’re here - let’s get started!

### Questions

This interview is more broad — questions from all previous interviews are fair-game, and be sure to adjust the questions asked to follow-up on any areas the other interviewers have indicated.

- “Tell me about yourself”

- "Has anyone given you any background on 18F or spoken with you in detail about 18F’s history, purpose, and mission?"
    - If not, fill them in; if so, answer questions (if they've got them).

- ["What drew you to 18F?"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.6qssbuvkhie2)

Make a note of key phrases or words that the candidate mentions their response (e.g., “I want my work to have a meaningful impact”); you can use these for hooks that there are hooks for questions later in the interview as you transition from one set of questions to the next.
  - If possible, be prepared to notify the TTS Talent Team about how this candidate entered our candidate funnel should we extend an offer (this helps improve our outreach efforts).

- ["Tell me about your experience with agile or other collaborative working styles. How does working in an agile way affect the technical choices you make?"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.p3zgydisjuv3)

- ["Have you had a chance to participate in user-centered design and/or user research?"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.z49dyqcuxle5)

- ["Have you ever worked with a remote/distributed team before?"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.95oxlva5ufr7)

- ["Pick a foundational web development concept or technology and explain it at two levels: first as you would to a colleague who’s not a software developer, like a designer or product manager; next, as you would to a peer."](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.8lizmty3jisl)

- "At 18F we strive to be as representative of the populace as possible and work hard to ensure that everyone understands this notion and is treated fairly and respectfully. [What do diversity, equity, and inclusion mean to you?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.5kwvj8b9hvhd)"

- ["Is there anything that you feel we should have asked you relating to your personal or professional goals that we did not?"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.frpyzn3gj97y)

### Conclusion

Make sure to leave time for the candidate to ask you any questions they might have — remember, interviewing is a two-way street!
