The goal of the wrap-up interview is to address any concerns that may be outstanding in order to prepare for a hiring decision.

{% include unconscious-bias-warning.html %}

## Purpose

The wrap-up interview accomplishes two purposes:

1. **Follow-up on any topics which other interviews did not address in-depth.** When reviewing notes, interviewers may have additional areas where they wished they would have had a deeper understanding — this interview provides an opportunity to follow-up.

2. **Provide a second opinion on core values and technical topics.** This can serve to better define some of the candidates answers when discussing them during the [debrief meeting]({{site.baseurl}}/debrief/).

The interview should last roughly one hour, and include some segments in which the interviewers provide more detail about 18F to the candidate and openly share their experiences working at 18F — remember, interviewing is a two-way street!

## Before the interview

- Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the candidate’s resume and review [the good and bad signs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9A0WJFJj_Vo975RkuzQQazEOSJTPixiiahrtlNOBiI/edit#heading=h.gnx56b2uwyx7) for the questions you’ll be asking.

- Ask the other interviewers if there are any areas to probe (without asking *why* — that will bias your opinion of the candidate’s answers).

## Conversation outline

{% include notes-reminder.html %}

Begin by introducing yourself by saying this or something similar to it:

> Hello! My name is \_\_\_, my pronouns are \_\_\_, and my role at 18F is \_\_\_.
>
> Thanks for interviewing with me today. This will be a behavioral interview, which means I’ll ask a series of questions about experiences you’ve had and how you handled them. There are no “right” answers; I’m interested in talking through these situations with you. I’ve got about [4-5 questions], and this will take us about an hour, perhaps a bit less. Don’t be surprised if others have asked the same questions in other interviews; that’s normal. Feel free to think for a moment before answering if that's your style - you won't be judged for it.
>
> There will be times when I ask for more information, or want to dig deeper into your answers. That’s normal, too: I want to make sure I understand what you did and why. I’ll be taking notes, please don’t let that distract you.
>
> I’ll ask you my questions first, and then I’ll leave some time to answer any questions you’ve got for me. I’m excited you’re here - let’s get started!

### Questions

This interview is more broad — questions from all previous interviews are fair-game, and be sure to adjust the questions asked to follow-up on any areas the other interviewers have indicated.
