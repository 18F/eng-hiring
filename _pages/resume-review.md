title: Resume review guide
---

This is a guide for staff conducting resume review (or, in formal speak "crediting").

Your main goal as a resume reviewer is to be **quick** and **fair**. You should aim to spend 5-10 minutes per
candidate, and this guide will help you figure out how to do that.

Each position will come with a scoring rubric (the formal term for this is a "crediting plan"). This is how we get fairness out of the process: this guide gives the specific experience and qualifications required for the job, and lets you review resumes against a consistent set of requirements.

Before you begin a review session, [remind yourself to watch out for unconscious bias](./unconcious-bias.md). Humans are not only biased, but we're almost never realize that we're being biased. However, when we realize and accept bias, and recognize it, we can be on the lookout for bias and it'll be less likely to unconsciously guide our decisions.

## Crediting plans

Each position comes with a *crediting plan* -- a formal resume review rubric that we use to "score" resumes and separate applications into a set that'll move on to interviews, and a set we'll reject. 

Check the sidebar for links to all the ones we have for engineering roles, and for convenient single-page checklists you can print out and use while reviewing resumes if you like.

These guides are rather formal, so let's walk through what they look like. The relevant part of the guide for resume review purposes is the "crediting plan". The crediting plan breaks down into several *competencies*, with each competency having several *criteria*. As you review the resume, you're looking for evidence of these criteria. At the end, the application gets scored based on how many of each criteria are demonstrated, according to a scoring guide in the crediting plan. Note that there's a different crediting plan for each GS-level.

Here's an example, from the Backend Engineer crediting plan, GS-15 version:

![Crediting Plan Example]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/crediting-plan-example.png)

So, as you review the resume, you'll be looking for evidence of the things cited in the "criteria for job readiness" section: specific programming languages, relational databases, source control, etc. If the candidate meets 4 or more of those criteria, they'd get the full 20 points for this section. If the only have 2-3, they'd get 14 points. Just 1, or none? 0 points.

(These numbers and point values will be the same for each competency, and we're going to try to keep them consistent throughout all the engineering roles.)

It's hard to find "hard proof" of any of this on a resume, so don't concern yourself too much with quantifying exactly *how much* experience someone has, or how *well* they've done these things. If they mention the experience required, it counts. The interview process should shake out how *well* they know these things.

## How to review a resume

OK, you've got the crediting plan; how do you use it to review a resume?

It may seem daunting to try to work through this guide in under 10
minutes, but if you’re consistent and follow a simple workflow, you can
blaze through and get good results quickly. 

When you look at a resume, look at the following things, in this order:

1.  Job history: titles, dates, companies, and career progression
2.  Responsibilities, accomplishments, and relevant experience
3.  “Bonus items”: education, open source, volunteer work, etc.

(More details on what to look for in each section below.)

This order’s deliberate: the first couple items are quick, and will help "orient" you to the candidate's overall experience, and help focus where you look for the rest. \#2 is the hardest, and will reveal the most detail. The last is least important, and you can skip it if you've already got a clearly qualified applicant. But for those on the edge, these parts can add a bit of extra experience that pushes someone over.

Remember that you’re reviewing a candidate’s entire submission package, which’ll include a resume and some Q&A, and possibly other links (e.g. to LinkedIn, a Github profile, etc). Make sure to scan the whole package for info that’s there, but maybe not on the cover letter. (But see [correcting for unconscious bias](./unconcious-bias.md) for an important note about avoiding social media).

You’ll want to have the crediting plan open in front of you as you proceed. You may want to print out the single-page checklist for the relevant position and grade level, and use it to mark off experience as you go.

### 1. Review job history 

First, review the candidate’s job history. You’re looking here at job
titles, dates of employment, where they’ve worked, and their overall
career progression. This is quick: expect to spend about one minute
here.

There isn’t a lot here that can *qualify* a candidate: it’s really hard
to tell whether a Senior Teapot Engineer at Company A is more qualified
than a Lead Teapot Technician at Company B, or even if those two jobs
have anything in common! However, looking at these items *can* quickly
reveal where to look for the experience in the next steps.

You're also looking for a couple of "red flags":

- Do the job titles and companies “make sense” show experience in the areas
  required by the job description / scoring guide? For example, if a candidate’s
  applying for a security role, but their resume doesn’t show any titles with
  “security” in them, or is filled with companies that aren’t in the technology
  sector at all, that’s a red flag.

- Are the dates of employment relatively long and consistent? In tech
  it’s much more common to job-hop than in other fields, but a
  candidate who’s worked six jobs in two years might be a problem.
  Similarly, gaps in employment aren’t unusual: long gaps could be
  during a recession, or when the tech bubble burst, or
  parenting, etc. But a pattern of repeated long gaps between every
  job over a long time indicates a weaker candidate.

These won't necessarily feed into the formal score the person receives at this step, but if you spot stuff like this, it's good to make a note of it to pass on to the phone screen and/or interviews for clarification.

### 2. Review responsibilities, accomplishments, and relevant experience

Next, look at each role, and what the candidate has written about that
role. his is the time consuming part, but as you get more familiar with each crediting plan it'll get quicker. 

For each role, you're looking to see:

- What were the candidate's responsibilities in that role?
- What were their accomplishments relative to those responsibilities?
- Are these applicable to the crediting plan you've got in front of you? One by one, take the criteria from the job
scoring guides, and compare against the experience the candidate has
cites. As you find relevant experience, mark it off.

### 3. Bonus items

If you've got a candidate who's already clearly qualified (e.g. has shown 4+ criteria in each competency already), you can skip this step. But if not, you can look at a candidate's cited volunteer work, open source contributions, and the like -- there may be additional relevant experience there.

## Scoring the candidate

Once you've reviewed the resume and found all the relevant experience, you'll need to submit a formal review and
score. There will be a Google Form for the role that you'll fill this information into, and you'll score according to the scoring guide (see [crediting plans](#crediting-plans), above, for details
