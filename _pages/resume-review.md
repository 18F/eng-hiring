# Infosec resume review guide

*A guide for staff conducting resume review for the infosec positions. Note that
this is a different sort of resume review than for other 18F positions,
which require a more formal qualification process. Specifically, the infosec
jobs are Direct Hire, so we don’t need to follow the formal qualification
process at this point. HR will qualify candidates after we submit them, at
the end of the interview process.*

Resume reviews should be **quick** -- you should aim to spend maybe 3-5
minutes per resume (less, even just a minute or two, for clearly
unqualified candidates). You can’t tell a great deal about a candidate
from a resume, so resume review is really about sorting out obviously
unqualified candidates before we spend a bunch of our (and their) time
interviewing.

Your goal should be to answer two fairly simple questions:

1.  Should we pass this person on to the next step (a phone screen)?

2.  Based on what you’ve seen so far, how strong a candidate is this?

These questions together will be used to prioritize phone screens and
interview time -- we want to try to look at the strongest candidates
first. You’ll answer these questions by filling out a Lever feedback
form. There’s also a space for general comments, if you want to leave
them.

I’ll go into some depth about how to look at a resume to answer these
questions below.

## Correcting for unconscious bias

Remember that we all have unconscious bias, and that this sort of rough
“gut check” review is especially susceptible to bias. A couple of
suggestions to help correct for bias:

- **Remember that we’re especially susceptible to assume that underrepresented
  minorities -- women, people of color, etc. -- are less qualified than their
  white male counterparts.** One way to correct for this bias by spending slightly
  longer considering applications that appear to be from underrepresented
  minorities, and try to view their qualifications in the best possible light.

- **Don’t check out the candidate on social media, or Google them**. A person’s
  public profile almost certainly won’t have anything relevant to work, and might
  instead reveal all sorts of irrelevant information (age, gender, political
  affiliation, race, etc.). If the candidate application/resume links to a
  personal website, LinkedIn, or GitHub you can check those out -- these are more
  work-focused, and we can assume a candidate has put what they want an employer
  to see there. If you use Chrome, [*the Unbias Me*](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unbias-me/bghhadboobnoikppffdojcebigmcgmam?hl=en) extension (written by Fureigh) can help by removing avatars and names.

- **If you come to a conclusion very quickly, before you’ve read the whole
  resume, spend the next few minutes trying to disprove that snap judgement.**
  Snap judgements are much more likely to be prone to bias than considered ones.
  We tend to jump to conclusions and then look for evidence to support our
  hypothesis. To compensate, if you find you’ve reached a Yes/No conclusion very
  quickly, spend the next few minutes trying to *disprove* that hypothesis.
  Explicitly look for evidence that you’re wrong. If you’ve decided immediately
  that a candidate is not qualified, spend the next couple of minutes trying as
  hard as you can to find evidence that they *are* qualified.

## How to review a resume

It may seem daunting to try to answer these questions in under 5
minutes, but if you’re consistent and follow a simple checklist, you can
blaze through and get good results quickly. You should look for the
following things, in this order:

1.  Job history: titles, dates, companies, and career progression
2.  Responsibilities and accomplishments
3.  Relevant experience
4.  “Bonus items”: education, open source, volunteerism, etc.

(More details on what to look for in each section below.)

This order’s deliberate: the first couple items are quick, and can help
to quickly spot unqualified candidates. \#3 is the hardest, and will
reveal more about potentially-qualified candidates. The last is least
important, but can add “bonus points” to an already-strong resume.

Remember that you’re reviewing a candidate’s entire submission package,
which’ll include a resume and some Q&A, and possibly other links/files
etc. Make sure to scan the whole package for info that’s there, but
maybe not on the cover letter. (But [*see above for an important caveat
about social media*](#correcting-for-unconscious-bias)!)

You’ll want to have the job descriptions ([AppSec](FIXME) / [Pentest](FIXME) /
[SecOps](FIXME)) open in front of you to compare to the resume as you go.

### 1. Review job history 

First, review the candidate’s job history. You’re looking here at job
titles, dates of employment, where they’ve worked, and their overall
career progression. This is quick: expect to spend about one minute
here.

There isn’t a lot here that can *qualify* a candidate: it’s really hard
to tell whether a Senior Teapot Engineer at Company A is more qualified
than a Lead Teapot Technician at Company B, or even if those two jobs
have anything in common! However, looking at these items *can* quickly
reveal obvious “red flags” and/or obviously unqualified candidates.
You’re looking at things like:

- Do the job titles and companies “make sense” for the position
  they’re applying for. If a candidate’s resume doesn’t show any
  titles with “security” in them, or is filled with companies that
  aren’t in the technology sector at all, that’s a red flag.

- Are the dates of employment relatively long and consistent? In tech
  it’s much more common to job-hop than in other fields, but a
  candidate who’s worked six jobs in two years might be a problem.
  Similarly, gaps in employment aren’t unusual: long gaps could be
  during a recession, or when the tech bubble burst, or
  parenting, etc. But a pattern of repeated long gaps between every
  job over a long time indicates a weaker candidate.

Remember: at this point, the goal is to look for "obviously
unqualified", not to parse qualification out of a resume. We want to
find people who just obviously won't pass the interview, and save us
(and them) the time. Job titles won’t tell you if a candidate did a
*good* job, but they will reveal obviously unqualified applicants.

### 2. Review responsibilities and accomplishments

Next, look at each role, and what the candidate has written about that
role. This is also quick: another minute or two.

You’re looking to see:

- Does the candidate clearly list what their responsibilities were in
  that role?

- What were their accomplishments relative to those responsibilities?

- Are (some) of those responsibilities relevant to the job they’re
  applying for? You’ll look at this in more details next, so this is
  just a quick pass looking for obvious hits.

Candidates who can’t clearly indicate what their job was and don’t have
clear accomplishments are unlikely to be strong, and we should reject
them at this point. Similarly, candidates who didn’t have jobs with
responsibilities reasonably similar to what they’re going to do at 18F
are unlikely to warrant an interview.

At this point, you only need to proceed if you haven’t already decided
“no”. The next steps are about separating a “yes” from a “maybe.”

### 3. Review relevant experience

Next, look to see how well their submission aligns with the requirements
for the job. This is more time consuming -- it can take 3-5 minutes,
less as you get better -- but fairly simple: take the job requirements
from the job description
([*AppSec*](https://jobs.lever.co/18f/52e26cd1-0750-4481-af7f-8bb39e7dcde0)
/
[*Pentest*](https://jobs.lever.co/18f/a546d4f2-3db5-4a63-8af6-05fc9f0ec522)
/
[*SecOps*](https://jobs.lever.co/18f/8774d280-438e-487b-bacc-42056eb28d42))
and compare against the roles the candidate has had in the past.

You shouldn’t expect to find a 100% match -- nobody’s going to list all
their skills on a short resume, and nobody is good at all the things.
But you should expect to see a reasonable amount of matching experience,
and the more you see the stronger the candidate is. Someone with a
nearly complete overlap is someone we should interview first!

### 4. Review the “bonus items”

Finally, you can spend a minute checking for “nice to haves”. Nothing in
this section should be used to disqualify a candidate -- great
candidates might lack everything in this list -- but these things might
move a candidate from a weak to a strong recommendation, or from a “yes”
to a “hell yes”. Look at:

- Open Source: candidates with open source experience are great!
- Volunteerism, public service, or prior government service - this can indicate someone more aligned with our mission.
- Education: a relevant Computer Security or Information Security degree is by no means required, but if they’ve got one, that makes them a stronger candidate.
- Certifications: like education, a lack doesn’t indicate a weakness, a relevant cert does indicate someone invested in security as a career, which is good.
