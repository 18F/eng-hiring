title: Resume review guide
---

This is a guide for staff conducting resume review.

Resume reviews should be **quick** -- you should aim to spend maybe 3-5
minutes per resume (less, even just a minute or two, for clearly
unqualified candidates). You can’t tell a great deal about a candidate
from a resume, so resume review is really about sorting candidates into
rough "highly-qualified"/"maybe qualified"/"not qualified" buckets.

Each position will come with a guide to "scoring" the application (the formal
term for this is a "crediting plan"). This'll tell you about the specalized
experience required for the job, and will produce a "score" that prioritizes
who'll move on to phone screen.

Before you begin a review session, [remind yourself to watch out for unconcious bias](./unconcious-bias.md). Humans are not only biased, but we're almost never realize that we're being biased. However, when we realize and accept bias, and recognize it, we can be on the lookout for bias and it'll be less likely to unconciously guide our decisions.

## How to review a resume

(FIXME below here)

It may seem daunting to try to answer these questions in under 5
minutes, but if you’re consistent and follow a simple checklist, you can
blaze through and get good results quickly. You should look for the
following things, in this order:

1.  Job history: titles, dates, companies, and career progression
2.  Responsibilities and accomplishments
3.  Relevant experience
4.  “Bonus items”: education, open source, volunteerism, etc.

(More details on what to look for in each section below.)

This order’s deliberate: the first couple items are quick, and can help
to quickly spot unqualified candidates. \#3 is the hardest, and will
reveal more about potentially-qualified candidates. The last is least
important, but can add “bonus points” to an already-strong resume.

Remember that you’re reviewing a candidate’s entire submission package,
which’ll include a resume and some Q&A, and possibly other links/files
etc. Make sure to scan the whole package for info that’s there, but
maybe not on the cover letter. (But [*see above for an important caveat
about social media*](#correcting-for-unconscious-bias)!)

You’ll want to have the job description and crediting plan open in front
of you; that'll tell you what to look for.

### 1. Review job history 

First, review the candidate’s job history. You’re looking here at job
titles, dates of employment, where they’ve worked, and their overall
career progression. This is quick: expect to spend about one minute
here.

There isn’t a lot here that can *qualify* a candidate: it’s really hard
to tell whether a Senior Teapot Engineer at Company A is more qualified
than a Lead Teapot Technician at Company B, or even if those two jobs
have anything in common! However, looking at these items *can* quickly
reveal obvious “red flags” and/or obviously unqualified candidates.
You’re looking at things like:

- Do the job titles and companies “make sense” show experience in the areas
  required by the job description / scoring guide? For example, if a candidate’s
  applying for a security role, but their resume doesn’t show any titles with
  “security” in them, or is filled with companies that aren’t in the technology
  sector at all, that’s a red flag.

- Are the dates of employment relatively long and consistent? In tech
  it’s much more common to job-hop than in other fields, but a
  candidate who’s worked six jobs in two years might be a problem.
  Similarly, gaps in employment aren’t unusual: long gaps could be
  during a recession, or when the tech bubble burst, or
  parenting, etc. But a pattern of repeated long gaps between every
  job over a long time indicates a weaker candidate.

At this point, the goal is to look for "obviously unqualified", not to parse
qualification out of job titles. Job titles won’t tell you if a candidate did a
*good* job, but they will reveal obviously unqualified applicants.

### 2. Review responsibilities and accomplishments

Next, look at each role, and what the candidate has written about that
role. This is also quick: another minute or two.

You’re looking to see:

- Does the candidate clearly list what their responsibilities were in
  that role?

- What were their accomplishments relative to those responsibilities?

- Are (some) of those responsibilities relevant to the job they’re
  applying for? You’ll look at this in more details next, so this is
  just a quick pass looking for obvious hits.

Candidates who can’t clearly indicate what their job was and don’t have clear
accomplishments are unlikely to be strong, and should get low scores. Similarly,
candidates who didn’t have jobs with responsibilities reasonably similar to what
they’re are required for the role should get low scores.

At this point, you only need to proceed if you haven’t already decided
“no”. The next steps are about separating high scores from low scores.

### 3. Review relevant experience

Next, look to see how well their submission aligns with the requirements for the
job. This is more time consuming -- it can take 3-5 minutes, less as you get
better -- but fairly simple: one by one, take the job requirements from the job
description and scoring guides, and compare against the roles the candidate has
had in the past.

See below under [Scoring the candidate](#scoring-the-candidate) for how to map
experience here to score. In general, the scoring guide will tell you how to
do this.

## Scoring the candidate

Once you've reviewed the resume, you'll need to submit a formal review and
score. Each job will come with a formal scoring guide that'll list a series of
competancies, the required criteria for each competancy, and an evaluation guide
for that area. For example, you might see something like:

    > **Teapot Engineering Skill (GS-15 level)**

    > **Criteria for job readiness**:
    > - Cites experience with building teapots using clay, cast iron, and wood.
    > - Cites experience delivering teapots for various group sizes, including individual and large parties.
    > - Cites pouring experience with teapots that are short and stout.

    > **Evaluation**:
    > (20) Yes, the candidate has studied this exact subject before, has done exactly what the job demands, and has mastered all the tools and skills needed. (Demonstrates 2+ of the Criteria for Job Readiness at the GS-15 level)
    > (14) Yes, the candidate likely has the skills, education and/or experience to be job ready. (Demonstrates 1-2 of the Criteria for Job Readiness  at the GS-15 level)
    > (0) No, the candidate does not have the skills, education and/or experience to be job ready. (Demonstrates 0 Criteria for Job Readiness )

In other words, a score of (20) means the candidate is highly qualfied, a score of (14) means "somewhat qualfied", and a score of (0) is "not qualified". 

Each position will have its own scoring guide, which you'll need to follow
for each compentancy.
