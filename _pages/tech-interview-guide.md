For the following roles: [*Application Security
Engineer*](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/document/d/1AaJT5IhOnRnAvDAoIdFbA-l40x8c5J6PZFF6FNrrq1M/edit?usp=sharing),
[*Penetration
Tester*](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/document/d/1nzqJ6pD6VTqsvxuUc6ul1nixFGd3oaYkK7zTNc6j5Ao/edit?usp=sharing),
[*Security Operations
Engineer*](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/document/d/1-u1pUn1MR2PPF-c08Q8-XeJc0M0gB0mmz1fb5NYxlns/edit?usp=sharing).

# Overview

The purpose of this guide is to help us interview candidates. The
questions here are behavioral in nature, designed to get candidates
talking about specific situations and how they handled them. Guidelines
are suggested for evaluating the strength of the answers.

Whenever possible, ask these questions *exactly as they’re worded* to
try to get consistency between multiple candidates. When interviewing,
please take notes, and *note what the candidate says, rather than your
impressions* — that will help you share behavior reasons for your
conclusions and decisions.

*Remember to be as pleasant and friendly as you can be!* You can deliver
a demanding interview while being kind and empathetic.

# Introductory Statement

*You should say this, or something close to it, before beginning:*

> Thanks for interviewing with me today. This’ll be a behavioral interview,
which means I’ll ask a series of questions about experiences you’ve had and
how you handled them. There are no “right” answers; I’m interested in
talking through these situations with you. I’ve got about 4-5 questions, and
this will take us about an hour, perhaps a bit less. Don’t be surprised if
others ask the same questions in other interviews; that’s normal.

> There’ll be times when I ask for more information, or want to dig deeper
into your answers. That’s normal, too: I want to make sure I understand what
you did and why. I’ll be taking notes, please don’t let that distract you.

> I’ll ask you my questions first, and then I’ll leave some time to answer
any questions you’ve got for me. I’m excited you’re here - let’s get
started!

# General questions

for candidates in all three roles.

*What was the situation?*

*What did you do? Why?*

*What other options did you consider? Why did you decide on the path you took?*

*What was the outcome? What did you learn?*

- Did not analyze required change methodically
- Cannot demonstrate an improved outcome

### Great Signs

- Understands and articulates how the change improved security posture
- Made changes systematically and broadly
- Understands and articulates required tradeoffs
- Makes methodical, data-driven changes to practice/policy

## Tell me about how you have worked with a team to remediate a security issue.

*What was the issue?*

*What was the fix? What other approaches did you consider?*

*How did you communicate with the rest of the team?*

*How did you and the rest of the team stay aligned on the required work?*

*What was the outcome? What did you learn?*

### Warning signs:

  the team

- Did not make efforts to explain to the rest of the team, only
  highlight errors

- Worked to increase the team’s understanding of the issue and fix

## Tell me about an innovative idea (i.e. a tool, practice, or policy) that you helped introduce.

*What was the new idea? What problem did it solve?*

*How was the new idea an improvement on the previous thing?*

*How did you manage the change?*

*What was the outcome? What did you learn?*

### Warning signs:

-   Idea was implemented without consideration for others

-   Used role / power rather than persuasion to implement

-   Improvement was unsuccessful or incomplete

-   Idea for “new for newness sake”, rather than showing a strong
    understanding of context

-   Idea shows sensitivity to context and applicability

## Describe a situation where you disagreed with someone about a security issue.

*What was the issue? What was the disagreement?*

*What was your point of view? What was theirs?*

*How did you resolve the disagreement? What was the final decision?*

*How did you feel about the outcome? How did the other party feel?*

*What did you learn?*

    non-collaborative method

### Great signs:

# Questions for Penetration Testers

These questions are specifically for the [*Penetration
