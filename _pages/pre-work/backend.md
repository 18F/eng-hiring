**TODO: flesh this out**

Backend engineers have two options:

1. Complete the `middleware`, `proto`, or `slcsp` exercises from the [Ad Hoc Team homework problems](https://github.com/adhocteam/homework) repo. `middleware` is a Go-specific challenge, the other two may be impemented in a language of the candidate's choice. If that language isn't Python, Ruby, JavaScript, or Go, please check with us first.

2. Bring a code sample from elsewhere to share and discuss. Subject to a few condidtions:
    - You must have permission to share this code with us (open source is best)
    - It should be in Python, Ruby, Go, or JavaScript -- if it's not, check with us first.
    - It should be short, something like 100 - 1,000 lines, and mostly stand-alone (shouldn't have any dependancies that aren't super-commen in the language in question).
    - Ideally, it should be code we can actually run and play around with.

## Review questions 

- Walk me through how this works
- Why did you use `X` here? What other options did you consider?
- Can you think of other ways to implement this bit?
- Where did you get stuck? How'd you get past it?
- What resources did you use while working on this?
- If you got to do this over again, what would you do differently?
