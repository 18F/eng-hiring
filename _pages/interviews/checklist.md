## At least 30 minutes before the interview:
- Make sure your blood sugar is good and consider having a snack — you'll be less fair to candidates if you're hungry!
- [Review the guide for correcting unconscious bias]({{site.basurl}}/unconscious-bias)
- Review the interview guide you'll be using
- Prepare your notes doc
- Review the candidate's application materials (linked in the calendar invite you received from Talent)
- Check in with the other interviewers for any topics you should cover

## Immediately after the interview:
- Let the next interviewer know that you're done
- Share any topics that you'd like future interviewers to cover, without sharing why (so as not to bias them)

## Within a day:
- Review your notes and highlight good and bad signs in the candidate's answers ([example notes document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NOfiIX8MQq_tq7BcRo37VDezdeKjWPxETYP-fjI6MRY/))
- Briefly summarize what you learned about the candidate
- Fill out the feedback form
- Tock the time you spent interviewing (you can find the Tock code in the calendar invite you got from Talent)
