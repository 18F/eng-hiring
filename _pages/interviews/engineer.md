title: Technical Engineering Interview Guide
parent: interviews

The purpose of this guide is to help us interview engineering candidates. The
questions here are behavioral in nature, designed to get candidates
talking about specific situations and how they handled them. Guidelines
are suggested for evaluating the strength of the answers.

Whenever possible, ask these questions **exactly as they’re worded** to
try to get consistency between multiple candidates. When interviewing,
please take notes, and *note what the candidate says, rather than your
impressions* — that will help you share behavior reasons for your
conclusions and decisions.

**Remember to be as pleasant and friendly as you can be!** You can deliver
a demanding interview while being kind and empathetic.

[For more information on interviewing in general, check out the interviewing guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/interviews/).

# Introductory Statement

**You should say this, or something close to it, before beginning:**

> *Thanks for interviewing with me today. This’ll be a behavioral interview,
which means I’ll ask a series of questions about experiences you’ve had and how
you handled them, or about how you'd handle hypothetical situations. There are
no “right” answers; I’m interested in talking through these situations with you.
I’ve got about 4-5 questions, and this will take us about an hour, perhaps a bit
less. Don’t be surprised if others ask the same questions in other interviews;
that’s normal.*

> *There’ll be times when I ask for more information, or want to dig deeper
into your answers. That’s normal, too: I want to make sure I understand what
you did and why. I’ll be taking notes, please don’t let that distract you.*

> *I’ll ask you my questions first, and then I’ll leave some time to answer
any questions you’ve got for me. I’m excited you’re here - let’s get
started!*

*For DevOps/SRE candidates: don't miss the [DevOps/SRE question supplement]({{ site.baseurl }}/interviews/devops/).*

## Problem Solving

These questions probe for the ability to design, analyze, synthesize and/or evaluate information
to produce and defend a desired solution.

Preface saying there’s no right answer, that we’re just looking to talk through the problem with the candidate.

Help guide the candidate to the right line of thinking, don’t allow them to get too bogged down in the wrong line of thinking, help them get back on track.

* ["Imagine you’re designing software to run elevators and talk through a high level design. How would accommodating different building types change your design?"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.tgd47iei6k4w)

* ["Tell me about a difficult technical problem that you helped solve: what was the problem, and how was it solved?"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.ory7bezha9al)

## Agile Orientation

* ["Tell me about your experience with agile or other collaborative working styles. How does working in an agile way affect the technical choices you make?"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.p3zgydisjuv3)

## Maintainable Software Development

This probes for the ability to develop software in a repeatable and documentable way, with emphasis on automation, testing, measuring, and scaling infrastructure.

* ["What does refactoring mean to you? Why is it important and when have you done it? Where does it belong in the process?"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.iiceusfwxdz6)

* ["Tell me about your approach to software testing. Why is it important and when have you done it? Where does it belong in the process?"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.8vmh70tr7j6b)
