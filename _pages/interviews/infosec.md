# Overview

The purpose of this guide is to help us interview infosec candidates. The
questions here are behavioral in nature, designed to get candidates
talking about specific situations and how they handled them. Guidelines
are suggested for evaluating the strength of the answers.

Whenever possible, ask these questions **exactly as they’re worded** to
try to get consistency between multiple candidates. When interviewing,
please take notes, and *note what the candidate says, rather than your
impressions* — that will help you share behavior reasons for your
conclusions and decisions.

**Remember to be as pleasant and friendly as you can be!** You can deliver
a demanding interview while being kind and empathetic.

[For more information on interviewing in general, check out the
interviewing guide](..).

# Introductory Statement

**You should say this, or something close to it, before beginning:**

> *Thanks for interviewing with me today. This’ll be a behavioral interview,
which means I’ll ask a series of questions about experiences you’ve had and
how you handled them. There are no “right” answers; I’m interested in
talking through these situations with you. I’ve got about 4-5 questions, and
this will take us about an hour, perhaps a bit less. Don’t be surprised if
others ask the same questions in other interviews; that’s normal.*

> *There’ll be times when I ask for more information, or want to dig deeper
into your answers. That’s normal, too: I want to make sure I understand what
you did and why. I’ll be taking notes, please don’t let that distract you.*

> *I’ll ask you my questions first, and then I’ll leave some time to answer
any questions you’ve got for me. I’m excited you’re here - let’s get
started!*
