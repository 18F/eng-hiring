The goal of the core values interview is to determine whether or not the candidate’s personal and professional values align with 18F’s core values.

{% include unconscious-bias-warning.html %}

## Purpose

Broadly, the core value interview accomplishes two purposes:

1. **Tease out the candidate’s approach to value-centered agile teams.** Focus on agile, testing, open source/openness, and human centered design. While some technical discussion may come up, it should be kept high-level and general in nature.

2. **Learn about how the candidate deals with bureaucracy.**

The interview should last roughly one hour, and include some segments in which the interviewers provide more detail about 18F to the candidate and openly share their experiences working at 18F - remember, interviewing is a two-way street!

- **Remember to be as pleasant and friendly as you can be!** You can deliver a demanding interview while being kind and empathetic.

- Whenever possible, ask these questions **exactly as they’re worded** to try to get consistency between multiple candidates.

- For more information on interviewing in general, check out the [interviewing overview guide](..).

## Before the interview

Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the candidate’s resume and review [the good and bad signs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit) for the questions you’ll be asking.

## Conversation outline

{% include be-kind-and-write-down.html %}

Begin by introducing yourself by saying this or something similar to it:

> Hello! My name is \_\_\_, my pronouns are \_\_\_, and my role at 18F is \_\_\_.
>
> Thanks for interviewing with me today. This will be a behavioral interview, which means I’ll ask a series of questions about experiences you’ve had and how you handled them. There are no “right” answers; I’m interested in talking through these situations with you. I’ve got about [4-5 questions], and this will take us about an hour, perhaps a bit less. Don’t be surprised if others ask the same questions in other interviews; that’s normal. Feel free to think for a moment before answering if that's your style - you won't be judged for it.
>
> There will be times when I ask for more information, or want to dig deeper into your answers. That’s normal, too: I want to make sure I understand what you did and why. I’ll be taking notes, please don’t let that distract you.
>
> I’ll ask you my questions first, and then I’ll leave some time to answer any questions you’ve got for me. I’m excited you’re here - let’s get started!

### 18F's background, history, mission, and purpose

- "Has anyone given you any background on 18F or spoken with you in detail about 18F’s history, purpose, and mission?"
    - If not, fill them in; if so, answer questions (if they've got them).

- ["What drew you to 18F?"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.6qssbuvkhie2)

Make a note of key phrases or words that the candidate mentions their response (e.g., “I want my work to have a meaningful impact”); you can use these for hooks that there are hooks for questions later in the interview as you transition from one set of questions to the next.

### Relevant work experience

After the introduction, follow up with a discussion around relevant work experience. Tying into anything the candidate might have already responded with as well as their resume, guide the interview toward specific work experience(s) that are of interest to 18F’s current and future needs.

This question could go in a few different directions depending on the candidates experience. Ask one (or more) of the following:

- [Tell me a bit more about your experience at COMPANY / on PROJECT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.z49dyqcuxle5)
    - What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
    - If a project: Why did the project succeed/fail?
    - If a company: Why did/are you ultimately decide/deciding to move on?

- [Have you worked directly with customers/clients before?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.z49dyqcuxle5)
    - If applicable: Could you speak about a time when you dealt with a particularly difficult client?

    - If yes: Were you actively involved in helping your team/department/organization transition to agile?
        - What challenges did you face, if any, and how did you overcome them?
    - If no: What does agile software development mean to you?

### Communication and collaboration

Following a discussion around a candidate’s relevant work experience, transition into a more focused dialogue around communication itself.

Ask one (or more) of these questions, as appropriate:

- [Have you ever worked with a remote/distributed team before?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.95oxlva5ufr7)
    - If yes: What tools and/or mechanisms did you use to help promote open dialogue and foster communication between yourself and your teammates?
    - If yes: How did you overcome any communication challenges and barriers?
    - If no: what challenges do you anticipate? What do you think you'll need to be successful?

### Technology and open source

Regardless of whether or not the candidate is applying for a software development position, 18F relies heavily on technology and open source to execute its mission. This section focuses on those skills and experience.

- [Have you ever worked with open source before?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.3qcfg9pfhobk)
    - If applicable: What were you involved with, and what was your role?
    - If applicable: How did you contribute?

- [Are you comfortable with sharing your work in a public fashion?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.3qcfg9pfhobk)

- [Have you ever advocated for open source in a previous job?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.3qcfg9pfhobk)
    - If applicable: Were you successful in doing so, and why or why not?

### Diversity, equity, and inclusion

Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core values for 18F and the engineering chapter. These questions are meant to shed light on the candidate's experience and thoughts.

- "At 18F we strive to be as representative of the populace as possible and work hard to ensure that everyone understands this notion and is treated fairly and respectfully. [What do diversity, equity, and inclusion mean to you?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.5kwvj8b9hvhd)"

### Overall experience and outlook

Begin closing the interview by asking general questions to ensure we develop a more well-rounded picture of the candidate. These questions aren’t geared toward a specific job or work methodology. Instead, they’re meant to shed light into the candidate’s overall experience and outlook.

Ask one or more of the following:

- [Tell me about a time that something at work didn’t go well.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.6e8l8bhmhbi3)
- [Tell me about a time you worked with or for communities different than your own.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.6e8l8bhmhbi3)
- [Tell me about what you’ve done that you’re most proud of.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.6e8l8bhmhbi3)

### Conclusion

Wrap up the interview by tying things back to why the candidate is looking to join 18F. Hopefully the answers and discussions around the specific questions provide a modicum of context around the candidate’s motivations and desires, in which it will be a lot easier to determine if their personal and professional goals align with 18F’s needs and mission.

Ask one or more of the following:

- [Could you describe what you are looking for in your next job?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.frpyzn3gj97y)
- [What are your expected outcomes of joining 18F?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.frpyzn3gj97y)
- [What do you think you’ll be able to accomplish at 18F?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.frpyzn3gj97y)
- [Is there anything that you feel we should have asked you relating to your personal or professional goals that we did not?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.frpyzn3gj97y)

**Lastly, make sure to ask the candidate if they have any questions for you!**
