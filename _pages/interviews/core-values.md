title: Core Values Interview Guide
parent: interviews
---

The purpose of this document is to provide a loose, but structured script ensuring a smooth Core Values Interview experience for both the interviewers and the candidate. Ultimately, the goal of the Core Values interview is to determine whether or not the candidate’s personal and professional values align with 18F’s core values.

There are two aspects to the Core Values interview: tease out the approach to agile and how the candidate deals with bureaucracy. The core values interview should focus on agile, testing, open source/openness, and human centered design. While some technical discussion may come up, it should be kept high-level and general in nature. Lastly, the interview should last roughly one hour, but include some segments in which the interviewers provide more detail about 18F to the candidate and openly share their experiences working at 18F - remember, interviewing is a two-way street!

Whenever possible, ask these questions **exactly as they’re worded** to
try to get consistency between multiple candidates. When interviewing,
please take notes, and *note what the candidate says, rather than your
impressions* — that will help you share behavior reasons for your
conclusions and decisions. Guidelines are suggested for evaluating the strength of the answers.

**Remember to be as pleasant and friendly as you can be!** You can deliver
a demanding interview while being kind and empathetic.

interviewing guide](..).

# Introductory Statement

**You should say this, or something close to it, before beginning. Also be sure to inform about any last minute changes to the interview, such as an interviewer not being able to make it.**

> *Hello my name is ____ and my role at 18F is _____.*

> *Thanks for interviewing with me today. This’ll be a behavioral interview,
which means I’ll ask a series of questions about experiences you’ve had and
how you handled them. There are no “right” answers; I’m interested in
talking through these situations with you. I’ve got about 4-5 questions, and
this will take us about an hour, perhaps a bit less. Don’t be surprised if
others ask the same questions in other interviews; that’s normal.*

> *There’ll be times when I ask for more information, or want to dig deeper
into your answers. That’s normal, too: I want to make sure I understand what
you did and why. I’ll be taking notes, please don’t let that distract you.*

> *I’ll ask you my questions first, and then I’ll leave some time to answer
any questions you’ve got for me. I’m excited you’re here - let’s get
started!*

# Questions

## 18F's background, history, mission, and purpose

#### Questions/follow-ups:

- Has anyone given you any background on 18F or spoken with you in detail about 18F’s history, purpose, and mission?
- What drew you to 18F?

Make a note of key phrases or words that the candidate mentions their response (e.g., “I want my work to have a meaningful impact”) so that there are hooks for questions later in the interview as you transition from one set of questions to the next.

#### Great signs

- Candidate is informed and/or excited about 18F's mission and purpose

#### Warning signs

- Candidate is looking for a specific position that 18F does not have.
- Candidate is looking for a job with a different purpose than 18F’s open positions.

## Relevant Work Experience

After the introduction, follow up with a discussion around relevant work experience. Tying into anything the candidate might have already responded with as well as their resume, guide the interview toward specific work experience(s) that are of interest to 18F’s current and future needs. The goal here is to ascertain whether the candidate is generally well-equipped to hit the ground running in 18F and has the capacity and willingness to adapt and learn in the future.

#### Specific questions/follow-ups

- Tell me a bit more about your experience \[at &lt;X&gt; company / on &lt;Y&gt; project\]?
    - What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
    - If a project: Why did the project \[succeed / fail\]?
    - If a company: Why \[did / are\] you ultimately \[decide/deciding\] to move on?

- Have you worked directly with customers/clients before?
    - If applicable: Could you speak about a time when you dealt with a particularly difficult client?

- Have you had a chance to participate in user-centered design and/or user research?
    - If yes: Could you speak about a time when business needs or management directives conflicted with executing on a user-centered design approach?
    - If yes: How did you overcome this challenge and what was the resolution?
    - If no: What does user-centered design mean to you?

- Could you describe your experience with agile software development, if you have any?
    - If yes: Were you actively involved in helping your \[team / department / organization\] transition to agile?
        - What challenges did you face, if any, and how did you overcome them?
    - If no: What does agile software development mean to you?

A couple of things to keep in mind with the candidate’s responses in this area: pay attention to how they describe themselves in the context of any teams they’ve worked on and how they credit and fault themselves and others in the context of success and failures. Don't hesitate to asking clarifying questions to get a balanced view of their teammates' contributions and the candidate's.

#### Warning signs

- Candidate never speaks in the plural (we), even for team-based work.
- Any failures are always attributed to others; which indicates a lack of self-assessment / self-awareness.
- Work experience does not align with 18F needs or does not appear to have adequately prepared the candidate for what will be expected of them.
- Candidate does not engender a positive attitude to learning from mistakes and/or a willingness to experiment (completely risk averse); conversely, candidate is needlessly reckless with taking risks.

## Communication and Collaboration

Following a discussion around a candidate’s relevant work experience, transition into a more focused dialogue around communication itself. Given 18F’s highly distributed and diverse nature within a very bureaucratic and process-heavy organization, a candidate needs to be able to be pro-active, communicate effectively, and work well with a disparate team(s). What we’re looking for here is to see that the candidate is able to speak and write clearly, is not afraid to reach out to help move something along, work well with others, and above all is respectful.

#### Specific questions/follow-ups

- Are you comfortable with remote work?

- Have you ever worked with a remote/distributed team before?
    - If applicable: What tools and/or mechanisms did you use to help promote open dialogue and foster communication between yourself and your teammates?
    - If applicable: How did you overcome any communication challenges and barriers?

- Have you ever faced any challenges with a coworker or manager?
    - If applicable: How did you resolve the matter?

- What steps would you take to ensure that you and your team are always in sync with each other?

- Can you describe a time or situation in which you saw or noted something that wasn’t working well and advocated for an improvement?
    - If applicable: What challenges did you face in doing this?
    - If applicable: Did your efforts succeed or fail, and can you explain why?
    - If applicable: Did you solicit help from your colleagues and/or manager?

- What is your work ethic and how do you approach work?

- What is your preferred work/management style?

In general, a candidate that genuinely likes working with others to tackle challenges and isn’t afraid to step up to the plate when necessary to help keep things moving forward should be able to convey this clearly during this part of the interview. We also value candidates who do not silo themselves and/or the efforts of others.

#### Warning signs

- Candidate does not like or appears unwilling to work with teams.
- Candidate cannot effectively handle working with remote/distributed teams.
- Candidate describes experiences in which all others are to blame for communication breakdowns.
- Candidate does not solicit help and input from colleagues and instead exhibits hostile behavior in taking direct control over initiatives.
- Candidate has a history of working in isolation or siloing their efforts.

## Technology and Open Source

Regardless of whether or not the candidate is applying for a software development position, 18F relies heavily on technology to execute its mission. This final portion of specific interview questions should focus on whether or not the candidate has an open and adaptable mind to technology and if they understand the significance of its role in 18F.

#### Specific questions/follow-ups

- Have you ever worked with open source before?
    - If applicable: What were you involved with, and what was your role?
    - If applicable: How did you contribute?

- Are you comfortable with sharing your work in a public fashion?

- Have you ever advocated for open source in a previous job?
    - If applicable: Were you successful in doing so, and why or why not?

- What is your comfort level with peer-reviewed work?

- If applicable: Have you pro-actively sought additional training and/or peer review?

In this segment, we’re looking to see if the candidate has any experience working with open source or openly sharing their work before. Many jobs do not work in open source even if they use open source tools so it is understable if a candidate does not have any demonstrable experience, however they should possess an affinity for it. 18F relies heavily on open source and makes it a point to share as much as possible with the public to help promote transparency and public engagement, therefore the candidate should at least be comfortable with this notion.

#### Warning signs

- Candidate does not see value in open source.
- Candidate does not like sharing their work with others or is apprehensive about the notion of having their work critiqued openly.
- Candidate does not appear open or willing to learning new things and improving themselves.

## Diversity and Inclusion 

Diversity and inclusion are core values for 18F and the engineering chapter. These questions are meant to shed light on the candidate's experience and thoughts towards diversity and inclusion.

- At 18F we strive to be as representative of the populace as possible and work hard to ensure that everyone understands this notion and is treated fairly and respectfully.  Could you tell us what diversity and inclusion mean to you?  
- What kind of impact do you think you might have or want to have in helping us continue to improve our efforts?

#### Warning signs

- Answers do not include multiple representations of diversity (race, cultural, Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender (LGBT), disabilities, gender, age, religion, immigrants, socio-economic, etc.)
- Demonstrates no experience working with diverse groups
- Cannot explain why diversity is a positive thing

## Other/General Interview Questions

Begin closing the interview by asking general questions to ensure we develop a more well-rounded picture of the candidate. These questions aren’t geared toward a specific job or work methodology. Instead, they’re meant to shed light into the candidate’s overall experience and outlook.

#### Specific questions/follow-ups

- Tell me about a time that didn’t go well. What did you learn from it and how could it have been prevented?
- Tell me about a time you worked with or for communities different than your own.
- Tell me about what you’ve done that you’re most proud of.

The ideal candidate would go into a place of constructive reflection with these questions. It is useful information to know if the candidate can move in the right direction, even in pressured situations. The ability to be open about and learn from difficult situations (rather than covering up or viewing a challenge as an outright failure) is crucial to being successful at 18F and working well with others.

#### Warning signs

- Candidate claims to have learned nothing at all from an adverse experience.
- Candidate has no example of work to share that they are proud of or passionate about.

## Conclusion

Wrap up the interview by tying things back to why the candidate is looking to join 18F. Hopefully the answers and discussions around the specific questions provide a modicum of context around the candidate’s motivations and desires, in which it will be a lot easier to determine if their personal and professional goals align with 18F’s needs and mission. Lastly, make sure to ask the candidate if they have any other questions we did not touch on!

#### Specific questions/follow-ups

- Could you describe what you are looking for in your next job?
- What are your expected outcomes of joining 18F?
- What do you think you’ll be able to accomplish at 18F?
- Is there anything that you feel we should have asked you relating to your personal or professional goals that we did not?
- Do you have any other questions for us?

The big thing to lookout for in the final part of the interview is that the candidate takes advantage of following up - this showcases genuine, active engagement and excitement. Sometimes it is difficult at the end of the interview to come up with something else (bonus points if the candidate had questions prepared beforehand!), but even making remarks about previous questions having already been answered helps us know that the candidate has been engaged.

#### Warning signs

- Candidate contradicts themselves from earlier.
- Candidate has unrealistic expectations of the organization.
