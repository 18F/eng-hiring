* [“Tell me about a system you built/operated (or helped to build/operate) on top of a Infrastructure- or Platform-as-a-service?”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.8oo7fbtvctyj)

* [“What do Continuous Integration and/or Continuous Deployment mean to you? Why is it important? When have you done it?”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.q9bs0tbbozgq)

* [“You’re tasked with writing a guide for developers about ensuring high reliability for a web application. What topics would you cover?”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.ajllaso5g4ot)

* [“Tell me about an infrastructure problem that you helped solve (for example: slow app performance, unexpected downtime; a security breach; etc). What was the problem, and how did you solve it?”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYmx_93-mq2QrqICCo8SNk8hHmnPPonPA1kg0vhy540/edit#heading=h.7yjx1psw8p0j)
