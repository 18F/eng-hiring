title: Checking references
---

Follow [OPM's guide to reference checking](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/assessment-and-selection/other-assessment-methods/referencechecking.pdf), which is excellent. See specifically the questions for references on page 5.

Some specific notes for our positions:

- We should expect to get three good references. The Hiring Manager has some discression here -- if a candidate only can supply two references, that *may* be acceptable, but only in special circumstances.

- If a reference check turns up red flags, that's an immediate no-hire. Remember: these are people the candidate gave to us; we should expect to be hearing good things.

- If a reference check can only confirm dates of employement, that's not a red flag (there may be legal issues which would prevent a good reference). But the reference "doesn't count"; return to the candidate for new references.
