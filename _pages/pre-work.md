title: Technical Pre-work
---

TODO - fill this out

- Goal: bring technical work to an inteview, discuss with interviewer
- Generally candidates should get the option of "homework" or bringing code to show
    - homework: more fair (doesn't require tech work that can be shown), but more work
    - pre-existing work: easier, but not all candidates have it
- Pre-work shouldn't take more than about 3 hours
    - Candidates should know this when assigned pre-work, and should reach out if it takes longer (something might be wrong)
- Each poistion will have its own pre-work, and a guide to evaluating it
    - TL should ask when assigning pre-work what language they'll use so we can match to an interviewer with some conversant skill there
- Review of pre-work should focus on "why did you", "how did you", etc - not technical gotchas
- Pre-work is "due" 1 biz day before the interview, to give time for the reviewer to review
