title: Conducting phone screens
---

The goal of a phone screen is to quickly assess a candidate's rough fit for the position we're hiring, and to quickly screen out candidates who will obviously not work out. Broadly, phone screens accomplish two purposes:

1. Make sure the candidate is aware of the unique nature of the job, and is happy to move forward. Working at 18F isn't for everyone: we get paid less, have to deal with more bureaucracy, and face a monumentally difficult task. If candidates aren't up for the mission and challenge, we want to find that out quickly!

2. Quickly screen out candidates who obviously won't work out. Typically this is true for candidates who don't share our values, as that's something that's hard to assess from a resume but can shake out very quickly in a conversation. Occasionally it's about technical fit: a candidate has a resume that passed review, but in talking to them it's clear they want to work on things that don't really match what we do (or the resume made it sound like they did work that they seem to not really have done).

Most candidates pass the phone screen: it's a rough filter: it can't be used to really qualify a candidate, but it *can* be used to disqualify. It's also not uncommon for candidates to self-select out after the phone screen. This is particularly true for candidates who are financially-motivated; the GS-scale is well below tech industry norms.

Because phone screens rely heavily on personal judgment, and are inherently less scientific than the full suite of interviews, phone screeners should be especially wary about [correcting for unconscious bias]({{ site.baseurl }}/unconcious-bias/). Remember that we are not only biased, but we're almost never realize that we're being biased. However, when we realize and accept bias, and recognize it, we can be on the lookout for bias and it'll be less likely to unconsciously guide our decisions.

Phone screens are interviews, so it's a good idea to review the [general guidance around interviews]({{ site.baseurl }}/interviews/) before beginning. 

Please remember to [take notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/interviews/#take-notes): they can be very useful to future interviewers.

## Phone screen outline

1. Introduction:
    1. Introduce yourself - say a bit about your position, what you do, etc.
    1. Explain the purpose of the phone screen: to ask some basic questions, and make sure there's alignment on the role. Tell the candidate that you'll ask questions for about 25 minutes, and leave the last 5 for them.
1. The position:
    1. "What got you interested in 18F?"
    1. Explain the role - what the role does, where it fits into 18F, etc. Ask if the candidate has questions about the role.
    1. Pay scales: ask if the candidate has seen the GS-scales, and if they know the salary for the position. Clarify that, by default, offers will be at Step 1 (i.e. GS-14 Step 1, or GS-15 Step 1), though they may be able to negotiate for a higher step if they can show appropriate experience and salary from previous positions.
1. Technical experience:
    1. "If we do go on to a technical interview, what is your preferred programming language?"
    1. Ask about how the candidate considers themselves with regard to the role:
        - SRE candidates: devops, developer, ops?
        - Engineer candidates: devops, full stack, back end, front end? 
        - Security candidates: security engineering, security operations, pentesting?
    1. "Are there any other skill sets we should be talking about? Design, testing, juggling?"
1. Background and experience:
    1. "Tell me about your background and goals?" Ask follow-up questions here as necessary to ensure you leave the call with a sense of their contributions in past projects and professional goals for the future. Where possible try to touch on:
        - teamwork and communication
        - alignment with our core working styles (distributed teams, open source, agile processes)
        - alignment with our values around diversity and inclusion
1. "Do you have any questions for me?"

### What to look for during a phone screen

Broadly, we're looking for the same things in a phone screen as we do during the [rest of our interviews]({{ site.baseurl }}/interviews/) - technical qualifications, teamwork, alignment with our core values, and the like. As you'll notice, the good/bad signs below are drawn from those guides. However, phone screens are shorter, quicker, and rougher, and rely more on experience and judgment (this is why they're typically done by more experienced interviewers).

In essence, you're looking for candidates who are unlikely to pass the full interview suite. Remember [the golden rule]({{ site.baseurl }}/interviews/#golden-rule): you're looking for a reason to say "no". "Maybe's" are a bit more OK in the context of phone screens: you can pass someone through to a full interview, with notes for future interviewers to dig into. However, remember that you're committing four of your colleagues to an hour of interviewing each (and asking the candidate to do some pre-work and then four hours of interviews), so passing people through who you think might fail isn't exactly fair to us, or to them. 

Here are some specific things to look for during a phone screen:

#### Great Signs

- Candidate is informed and/or excited about 18F's mission and purpose
- Candidate is looking for work that aligns with the role's responsibilities
- Candidate talks about teamwork ("we" statements vs "I" statements)
- Candidate talks about the importance of team communication skills
- Candidate shows alignment to our core working style: distribute teams, open source, agile processes
- Candidate talks about the importance of diversity and inclusion to workplaces, teams, and/or outcomes

#### Red Flags

- Candidate is looking for a specific position that 18F does not have.
- Candidate is looking for a job with a different purpose than 18Fâ€™s open positions.
- Candidate never speaks in the plural (we), even for team-based work.
- Any failures are always attributed to others; which indicates a lack of self-assessment / self-awareness.
- Work experience does not align with 18F needs or does not appear to have adequately prepared the candidate for what will be expected of them.
- Candidate does not engender a positive attitude to learning from mistakes and/or a willingness to experiment (completely risk averse); conversely, candidate is needlessly reckless with taking risks.
- Candidate does not like or appears unwilling to work with teams.
- Candidate cannot effectively handle working with remote/distributed teams.
- Candidate describes experiences in which all others are to blame for communication breakdowns.
- Candidate does not solicit help and input from colleagues and instead exhibits hostile behavior in taking direct control over initiatives.
- Candidate has a history of working in isolation or siloing their efforts.
- Candidate does not see value in open source.
- Candidate does not like sharing their work with others or is apprehensive about the notion of having their work critiqued openly.
- Candidate does not appear open or willing to learning new things and improving themselves.
- Candidate has unrealistic expectations of the organization.
