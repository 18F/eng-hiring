The goal of a phone screen is to assess a candidate's rough fit for the position we're hiring, and to evaluate if a candidate should be interviewed for the position.

{% include unconscious-bias-warning.html %}

## Purpose

Broadly, a phone screen accomplishes two purposes:

1. **Make sure the candidate is aware of the unique nature of the job, and is happy to move forward.** Working at 18F isn't for everyone: some candidates are paid less than past positions, have to deal with more bureaucracy, and face a monumentally difficult task. If candidates aren't up for the mission and challenge, we want to find that out quickly!

2. **Screen out candidates who won't work out.** Candidates who don't share our values, do not match the required skills for the position, or are interested in working on things or in ways which we cannot offer.

Phone screens are performed by someone on the 18F Engineering Hiring team, and often the same person performs all phone screens for a given hiring group. Phone screens are a rough filter: it can't be used to really qualify a candidate, but it can be used to disqualify. It's also not uncommon for candidates to self-select out after the phone screen.

**Because phone screens are decided upon by a single individual, phone screeners should be especially wary about their unconscious bias.**

Please remember to take notes and pass them along: they can be very useful to future interviewers.

## Before the call

The candidate will have already received guidance from TTS Talent on what it’s like to interview at TTS and an explainer of payscales and term limits. This guide changes depending on the hiring authority used and the specifics of the role, but here’s an example [candidate guidance for a DHA role](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10n9DnWP07fjsRcM0Yw3z6OlbWi2nHcg0cKUhXIy-3po/edit) and for [a reserved hire role](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ci_PgaJty6esQ_C0yk8DKP_8ySpdaxR9plVbK7AO95o/edit).

Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the candidate’s resume, copy the notes template, and review what to look for during a phone screen.

## Conversation outline

Begin by introducing yourself by saying this or something similar to it:

> Hello! My name is \_\_\_, my pronouns are \_\_\_, and my role at 18F is \_\_\_. In a nutshell, 18F is a digital consultancy and we work with our clients, who we call our partners, to develop and modernize technologies in service of the American public.
>
> Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today! The purpose of this call is to make sure we’re on the same page about what 18F is and what the Consulting Software Engineer role entails, to ask a few questions to get to know you and your experience better, and to answer any questions that you may have.
>
> I’ll lead the conversation for about 45 minutes, and then hand the conversation off to you to answer any questions that you might have for the remaining 15 minutes.
>
> I’m excited that you’re here — are you ready to get started?

### Discuss the candidate’s career history and path forward

Give the candidate space to tell their story, so we can hear how they view themselves and where they are heading in their career.

- "Tell me about yourself."
  - "Tell me about a few of your recent projects."
- "What got you interested in 18F?"
- "What are you looking for in your next ideal role, and what things are most important for you?"

### Describe the role and ask for their experience

Reinforce information from the job post and gauge the candidate’s level of comfort, while learning how their experience applies to these areas.

#### Open source and technical experience

We are an open source organization that prefers working with languages and tools which help avoid locking in to specific vendors or organizations.

- "Can you tell me a bit more about [a project or projects you’ve worked on]? I’m looking to get a sense of the kinds of technology, tools, platforms, and frameworks you used."
- "If we were to go on to a technical interview, what would be your preferred programming language?"
- "Have you ever worked with open source or in public before?"

#### Consulting and coaching

We are a consulting organization. This role involves consulting — creating clarity around problems both technical and people-oriented, understanding and processing resistance to change, and applying your technical expertise to advise how a project will be most successful. As a consultant, we operate with influence but without authority on projects.

- "Technical problems aren’t always the hardest problems we face. Can you tell me about a time when you've needed to solve a problem that had a non-technical dimension? How did you approach it?"
- "Can you tell me about a time when you've been on a project with multiple competing stakeholders and how you navigated it?"
- "Can you tell me about a time when you've taught or coached others and how you went about it?"

#### Cross-functional teams

We work on cross-functional teams. To us, that means teams which are made up of people with talents in product, design, content, strategy, engineering, and management who work as peers with each other and with the subject matter experts — those who we are assisting in our projects.

- "Can you tell me about a time when you worked on a cross-functional team, especially one with user researchers or visual designers?"
- "Can you describe a time or situation in which you saw or noted something that wasn’t working well and advocated for an improvement?"
  - "Did your efforts succeed or fail, and can you explain why?"

#### Values and team contributions

We are a team that values diversity, equity, and inclusion. 18F is committed to building a safe, welcoming, harassment-free culture for everyone where we as individuals are free to take risks and challenge each other. We do not merely want a work environment that is free from hostility; we want one that is actively welcoming and inclusive. We want our team and our workplace culture to reflect and celebrate the diversity of the public we serve, and we work hard to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and respectfully.

- "What do you see the key factors are in enabling a team or organization to foster inclusiveness and belonging?"
- "Can you tell me about a time you’ve worked with or for communities different than your own, and what did you learn?"

#### Agility and agile methods

We start our projects by exploring the problem space and performing research to see if we’re solving the right problem. As projects advance, we repeatedly check-in with experts — the end-users — to see if our understanding of the problem and our current proposed solution are correct, and be able to adjust or pivot if we need to change course.

- "Can you tell me about a time when a project changed and you had to reset expectations for your work?"
- "Can you tell me about your experience with agile methods and practices and how they affected your work?"

#### Remote and distributed work

Even if you plan to work in one of our offices, you will be working with project teams which are geographically distributed. Under normal circumstances, you will be asked to travel occasionally (a few times a year) for 2-3 day periods to hold in-person workshops with project teams.

- "Have you ever worked with a remote/distributed team before?"
  - "How did you overcome any communication challenges and barriers?"
- "What do you think are the crucial skills, tools, and resources needed to make a remote-first team work well?"

### Leave time to answer their questions

- "What questions do you have for me?"

## After the call
