The goal of a phone screen is to quickly assess a candidate's rough fit for the position we're hiring, and to quickly screen out candidates who will obviously not work out.

{% include unconscious-bias-warning.html %}

## Purpose

Broadly, a phone screen accomplishes two purposes:

1. **Make sure the candidate is aware of the unique nature of the job, and is happy to move forward.** Working at 18F isn't for everyone: some candidates are paid less than past positions, have to deal with more bureaucracy, and face a monumentally difficult task. If candidates aren't up for the mission and challenge, we want to find that out quickly!

2. **Quickly screen out candidates who obviously won't work out.** Typically this is true for candidates who don't share our values, as that's something that's hard to assess from a resume but can shake out very quickly in a conversation. Occasionally it's about technical fit: a candidate has a resume that passed review, but in talking to them it's clear they want to work on things that don't really match what we do (or the resume made it sound like they did work that they seem to not really have done).

Phone screens are performed by someone on the 18F Engineering Hiring team, and often the same person performs all phone screens for a given hiring group.

Most candidates pass the phone screen. It's a rough filter: it can't be used to really qualify a candidate, but it can be used to disqualify. It's also not uncommon for candidates to self-select out after the phone screen. This is particularly true for candidates who are financially-motivated; the GS-scale can be below what some candidates feel is appropriate.

**Because phone screens rely heavily on personal judgment, and are inherently less scientific than the full suite of interviews, phone screeners should be especially wary about unconscious bias.**

Please remember to take notes and pass them along: they can be very useful to future interviewers.

## Before the interview

Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the candidateâ€™s resume and review [what to look for during a phone screen](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1La5M7YojZFEc0lvpQZ4Kc7dL8UgssBoJe3FqmmJwmK4/edit).

## Conversation outline

Begin by introducing yourself by saying this or something similar to it:

> Hello! My name is \_\_\_, my pronouns are \_\_\_, and my role at 18F is \_\_\_.
>
> Thanks for taking time to speak with me today! The purpose of this phone screen is to ask you some basic questions, and to make sure weâ€™re on the same page about what this role entails. Iâ€™ll ask you a few questions for about [25 minutes], and leave the last [5 minutes] to answer any questions you might have.
>
> Iâ€™m excited that youâ€™re here â€” are you ready to begin?

### Check for alignment on the role

- "What got you interested in 18F?"
- Explain the role: what the role does, where it fits into 18F, and other details you find relevant. When finished, pause and ask if the candidate has questions about the role.
- Pay scales: ask if the candidate has seen the GS-scales, and if they know the salary for the position. Clarify that, by default, offers will be at Step 1 (i.e. GS-14 Step 1, or GS-15 Step 1) though they may be able to negotiate for a higher step if they can show appropriate experience and salary from previous positions.
    - Refer to the [Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 2020 Salary Calculator](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2020/general-schedule-gs-salary-calculator/), but be sure 2020 is the current year. ðŸ˜‰

### Explore the candidateâ€™s technical experience

- "If we do go on to a technical interview, what is your preferred programming language?"
- "Have you seen our hiring guides?" Ensure the candidate knows these guides exist and how to access them.
- Ask about how the candidate considers themselves with regard to the role:
  - SRE candidates: devops, developer, ops?
  - Engineer candidates: devops, full stack, back end, front end?
  - Security candidates: security engineering, security operations, pentesting?
- "Are there any other skill sets we should be talking about? Design, testing, juggling?"

### Perform a quick screen for core values

- "Tell me about your background and goals?"
- Ask follow-up questions here as necessary to ensure you leave the call with a sense of their contributions in past projects and professional goals for the future. Where possible try to touch on:
  - Teamwork and communication
  - Alignment with our core working styles (distributed teams, open source, agile processes)
  - Alignment with our values around diversity and inclusion

### Leave time to answer their questions

- "Do you have any questions for me?"

## After the interview

**Thank you for your focus!** Use your notes to fill out the feedback form linked in the calendar invitation, which will help prepare for [interviews](/interviews/).
