The goal of the debrief meeting is to discuss the evidence and data the interview panel was able to learn about a candidate during the interview process.

{% include unconscious-bias-warning.html %}

## Purpose

The purpose of the debrief meeting is to:

1. **Share and discuss interview evidence and data.** Each interview has a different purpose and goals, and collects data about different aspects of the candidate. When this data is combined, it creates a more full view of the candidate. Do not share your interpretations, thoughts, or judgments about the candidate’s actions.

2. **Create a single, unified summary of a candidate, resolving any discrepancies in interview data.** This summary will be used by the 18F Engineering Hiring team to make a [final selection]({{site.baseurl}}/selection).

## Before the meeting

- If you haven’t already done so, fill out the feedback form from your interview calendar event.

- Review your interview notes, and be prepared to present a summary of the interview using the candidate’s own words.

- Review the goals and purpose of the interview you preformed, and be prepared to rate the candidate on a scale of 1 – 5:

  <table class="usa-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">❌ 1</th>
        <th scope="col">…</th>
        <th scope="col">✅ 5</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>The candidate showed large skill gaps or lacked some crucial ability to do the job.</td>
        <td>…</td>
        <td>The candidate showed great skills and ability to do the job.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  For candidates you did not rate a 5, what were you looking for that could have increased the candidate’s score?

## Conversation outline

Begin by introducing the meeting:

> Thank you for using your valuable non-billable time to help interview candidates for 18F Engineering. Helping out in this way has a very real impact on the future of our team, and we can’t say thank you enough for your assistance. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
>
> Please share your interview evidence, in order of the interview loop with the candidate. Please focus on evidence and data — what did the candidate say or do? — and not your interpretations, thoughts, or judgments about the candidate’s actions.
>
> At the end, please rate the candidate on a scale of 1-5 with 5s being “the candidate showed great skills and ability to do the job” and 1s being “the candidate showed large skill gaps or lacked some crucial ability to do the job.”
>
> For candidates you didn’t score a 5, what would you have liked to see to increase their score?

### Recap each interview, in interview order

For each interview, the interviewer reviews their notes and presents a summary of the interview, using the candidate’s own words whenever possible. Then, they present their ranking (1 – 5) and what could have been done to improve the score.

As other interviewers are presenting their summary, pay attention to any discrepancies in what you believe to be true about the candidate, or anything that catches you off guard.

### Open the floor for discussion

After all interviews are complete, open the floor for any additional discussion:

> Now that you’ve heard everyone’s interview debrief, would anybody like to change their scores, or provide additional comments and thoughts?


## After the meeting

Thanks for your help in the interview process! It’s critically important to the future of our organization, and your help is _very much appreciated_.

Please retain your notes until the [final selection meeting]({{site.baseure}}/selection) meeting has finished, in case there are discrepancies or further questions that come up.
